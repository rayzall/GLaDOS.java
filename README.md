# GLaDOS.java
# *Java code that uses time exceptions and terminal flushes with strings to simulate Portal's credits sequence.*

GLaDOS.java is the main file where the verses are contained while GLaDOSArts.java is a separate file where the ASCII arts are contained

Both java program uses the WAVPlayerWindow.java

WAVPlayerWindow.java is just the separate file for the media player so it's easy for debugging.
